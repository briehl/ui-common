# Directories

Or where the files live:

## Primary Source Files
- ```app``` - kbase source code
    - ```client``` - code, html, styles, images loaded into the browser
    - ```server``` - a small nodejs http server to provide an interface to the client
- ```config``` - configuration templates for the runtime
- ```data``` - data files used by the client (in transition)
- ```docs``` - documentation for the UI in markdown
- ```kbase-clients``` -
- ```plugins``` - kbase ui components that are integrated into the client at runtime
- ```test``` - test harness for all elements of the ui system
- ```unused``` - files which are not currently used; perhaps will be used in the future.
- ```tools``` - 

## Packages and Building
- ```bower_components``` - external dependencies are installed here by bower
- ```node_modules``` - external dependencies required by tools and testing
- ```build``` - generated by the bower build task; this represents the deployed ui system for testing
- ```dist``` - also generated by the bower build task; this represents the deployed ui system for production usage

The top level directories are separated by function.

## app

This contains the KBase source code.

## app/client

The client directory contains the code that composes the UI front end and is loaded into the browser.

## app/server

The server directory contains the nodejs server which provides the http interface to the client files.
